# ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic programming

### Scope

The Workshop on Generic Programming is an annual workshop, typically
organized in affiliation with an international conference.  Scope

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class
hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and to theoreticians, and for at least one decade
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research
in the programming language community. This workshop brings together
leading researchers in generic programming from around the world, and
features papers capturing the state of the art in this important
emerging area.  Next Workshop

### Current workshop

The 11th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic Programming (WGP 2015) will
be held in Vancouver, Canada, affiliated with ICFP 2015.

ACM SIGPLAN.

### Steering Committee 

#### Responsibilities

The main purpose of the WGP Steering Committee is to provide
continuity of the workshop and to offer help and advice to the current
organizer(s) of the workshop.

The responsibilities of the steering committee are:

* To provide continuity of the GP Workshop and maintain the functional
  vision and vigour of the workshop.
* To officially represent the GP Workshop with the sponsoring
  organization.
* To appoint the GP Workshop Programme Chair each year, and approve
  the Programme Chair's choice of Programme Committee.
* To provide help and guidance to the GP Workshop Programme Chair in
  the overall technical organization of the workshop, as well with
  budget preparation and the cooperation with affiliated conferences
  and workshops.

#### Membership

The GP Workshop Steering Committee comprises the three previous GP
Workshop Programme (Co-)Chairs and three appointed Members-At-Large.

Each year, around the date of the GP Workshop, the Steering Committee
appoints the Programme (Co-)Chair(s) for the next GP Workshop. The
steering committee additionally appoints a new Member-At-Large to
succeed the currently longest serving Member-At-Large. The previous
WGP Programme (Co-)Chair and the newly appointed Member-At-Large then
join the Steering Committee, while the longest serving former
Programme (Co-)Chair and Member-At-Large step down.

The chair of the Steering Committee is one of the longest serving
Programme (Co-)Chairs.

Should there be vacancies within the Steering Committee, e.g. due to a
member stepping down early, the Steering Committee appoints members to
fill the vacancies and, if necessary, decides on the succession
ordering.

#### Present Members

The 2014/2015 members of the Steering Committee are:

* the (co-)chairs of the previous three workshops
    - Jacques Carette (end of term 2016)
    - Jeremiah Willcock (end of term 2016)
    - José Pedro Magalhães (end of term 2017)
    - Tiark Rompf (end of term 2017)
    - Patrick Bahr (end of term 2018)
    - Sebastian Erdweg (end of term 2018)
* three members-at-large
    - Stephanie Weirich (end of term 2015)
    - Tarmo Uustalu (end of term 2016)
    - Fritz Henglein (end of term 2017)

#### Programme Committee

The Programme Committee is responsible for the technical content of
the Workshop. The Workshop Chair, with the approval of the Steering
Committee, appoints the Programme Committee and leads its work.
