## Overview

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class
hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and to theoreticians, and, for at least 20 years,
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research
in the functional and object-oriented programming communities. Generic
programming has gradually spread to more and more mainstream
languages, and today is widely used in industry. This workshop brings
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
from around the world, and features papers capturing the state of the
art in this important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

* generic programming,
* programming with (C++) concepts,
* meta-programming,
* programming with type classes,
* programming with modules,
* programming with dependent types,
* type systems for generic programming,
* polytypic programming,
* adaptive object-oriented programming,
* component-based programming,
* strategic programming,
* aspect-oriented programming,
* family polymorphism,
* object-oriented generic programming,
* implementation of generic programming languages,
* static and dynamic analyses of generic programs,
* and so on.
