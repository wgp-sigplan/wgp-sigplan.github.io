# Overview

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to practitioners and to theoreticians, and, for at least 20 years, generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research in the functional and object-oriented programming communities. Generic programming has gradually spread to more and more mainstream languages, and today is widely used in industry. This workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming from around the world, and features papers capturing the state of the art in this important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as practical, of


*  generic programming,

*  programming with (C++) concepts,

*  meta-programming,

*  programming with type classes,

*  programming with modules,

*  programming with dependent types,

*  polytypic programming,

*  object-oriented generic programming,

*  adaptive object-oriented programming,

*  component-based programming,

*  strategic programming,

*  aspect-oriented programming,

*  family polymorphism,

and so on.

*  [Baltimore, 2010](http://osl.iu.edu/wgp2010/) (affiliated with ICFP 2010)

*  [Edinburgh, UK, 2009](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/WGP09/WGP09) (affiliated with ICFP09)

*  [Victoria, BC, Canada, 2008](http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/people/ralf.hinze/wgp2008/) (affiliated with ICFP08),

*  [Portland, 2006](http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/wgp2006.html) (affiliated with ICFP06),

*  [Ponte de Lima, 2000](http://www.cs.uu.nl/~johanj/wgp2000/wgp2000cfp.html) (affiliated with MPC),

*  [Marstrand, 1998](http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/conf/wgp/) (affiliated with MPC).

Furthermore, there were a few informal workshops

*  [Utrecht, 2005](http://www.cs.uu.nl/~johanj/DGP2005/) (informal workshop),

*  [Dagstuhl, 2002](http://www.cs.uu.nl/~johanj/wcgp/index.html) (IFIP WG2.1 Working Conference),

*  [Nottingham, 2001](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/wgp01.html) (informal workshop).

There were also (closely related) DGP workshops in Oxford (June 3-4 2004), and a Spring School on DGP in Nottingham (April 24-27 2006, which had a half-day workshop attached).

The WGP steering committee consists of J. Gibbons, R. Hinze, P. Jansson, J. Järvi, J. Jeuring, B. Oliveira, S. Schupp, and M. Zalewski. Visit the [WGP Permanent Home Page](http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/wgp-permanent.html) for general information about WGP.
